# üì° Telecom Churn Analysis

---

## üìå 1. Introduction and Project Context
This project aimed to analyze customer churn in telecommunications by combining SQL Server for data preparation, Power BI for visualization, and Python for predictive modeling. It demonstrates the ability to manage the full data pipeline and deliver insights to support retention strategies.

### üîç Problems to Address

- High customer churn rates negatively impacting revenue and business stability.
- Lack of tools and analysis to identify and understand churn drivers.
- Data inconsistency and missing values making it difficult to build predictive models.
- No interactive dashboards to support management in making timely, data-driven decisions.
### üéØ Analysis Objectives

- Clean and standardize telecom customer data to ensure high data quality for analysis and modeling.
- Identify key factors influencing customer churn to provide actionable insights for senior management.
- Segment customers by risk level to enable targeted retention strategies.
- Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI to monitor churn metrics and customer behavior.
- Build and evaluate predictive models (Random Forest) to forecast churn likelihood and support data-driven decision-making.

## üß≠ 4. Strategic Actions

- **Retention Campaigns:** Launch targeted discounts and promotions to encourage customers to switch from month-to-month contracts to longer-term agreements focusing especially on Fiber Optic users; run regional retention campaigns prioritizing Jammu & Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh where churn rates are highest.
- **Service Improvements:** Enhance technical support for Fiber Optic services and expand device protection offerings to increase perceived value; promptly resolve negative billing issues to rebuild customer trust.
- **Personalized Offers:** Design tailored packages for customers aged 20‚Äì50 including streaming bundles or security add-ons to better match their needs; promote credit card payments by offering incentives or reward programs.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Closely monitor customers with 12‚Äì18 months of tenure to detect early signs of churn risk; integrate churn prediction outputs into customer care workflows to proactively reach out before contract renewals.
